# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SmartGov Assistant is a citizen feedback management system that enables government agencies to collect, categorize, analyze, and gain insights from citizen feedback. The system uses AI agents to automatically categorize feedback by topic and sentiment, then provides summarized insights and trends to help government officials understand citizen concerns and emerging issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a citizen, I want to submit feedback about government services, so that my concerns can be heard and addressed by the appropriate departments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a citizen submits feedback text THEN the system SHALL store the feedback in the database with a timestamp
2. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the categorizer agent to process the feedback
3. WHEN feedback is successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation response to the user
4. IF the feedback submission fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a government official, I want feedback to be automatically categorized by topic and sentiment, so that I can quickly understand the nature and urgency of citizen concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new feedback is received THEN the categorizer agent SHALL analyze the text and assign a category (health, infrastructure, safety, other)
2. WHEN new feedback is received THEN the categorizer agent SHALL calculate a sentiment score for the feedback
3. WHEN categorization is complete THEN the system SHALL store the category and sentiment in the database
4. IF categorization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and assign default values (category: "other", sentiment: neutral)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a government official, I want to view all citizen feedback in a structured format, so that I can review individual submissions and their classifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all feedback in a table format showing text, category, and sentiment
2. WHEN viewing the feedback table THEN the system SHALL display feedback sorted by timestamp (newest first)
3. WHEN the feedback table loads THEN the system SHALL show pagination controls if there are more than 50 items
4. WHEN clicking on a feedback item THEN the system SHALL display the full feedback text and metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a government official, I want to see summarized insights and trends from citizen feedback, so that I can identify patterns and prioritize issues that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a summary panel with key insights from the last 100 feedback items
2. WHEN the summarizer agent runs THEN it SHALL group feedback by category and identify key complaints and emerging trends
3. WHEN summary data is available THEN the system SHALL display trends grouped by category (health, infrastructure, safety, other)
4. WHEN no recent feedback exists THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no data is available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a government official, I want to search through citizen feedback, so that I can find specific topics or issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering text in the search bar THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search across all feedback text
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display matching feedback items with relevance scoring
3. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message
4. WHEN clearing the search THEN the system SHALL return to displaying all feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the categorizer agent to run automatically when new feedback is submitted, so that all feedback is processed consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new feedback is submitted via the API THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the categorizer agent using agent hooks
2. WHEN the categorizer agent completes processing THEN the system SHALL update the feedback record with category and sentiment
3. IF the categorizer agent fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry up to 3 times
4. WHEN agent processing is complete THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard data automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the summarizer agent to run periodically, so that trend analysis is kept up-to-date with recent feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are new feedback items since the last summary THEN the summarizer agent SHALL process the last 100 feedback items
2. WHEN the summarizer agent runs THEN it SHALL cache the results in the database for quick retrieval
3. WHEN summary results are cached THEN the system SHALL serve cached data to the dashboard
4. IF the summarizer agent fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and use the last successful summary

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use TiDB Serverless for data storage, so that we have a scalable, MySQL-compatible database with vector search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to TiDB Serverless using MySQL-compatible drivers
2. WHEN storing feedback THEN the system SHALL use the defined schema: feedback(id, text, category, sentiment, timestamp)
3. WHEN performing vector searches THEN the system SHALL utilize TiDB's vector search capabilities
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to reconnect

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and well-designed, so that I can use the system effectively on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface using Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
3. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators to inform users of system status
